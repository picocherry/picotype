## Installation

### Manual Installation
1. Download the font files from the latest [release](https://github.com/picocherry/picotype/releases), or from the [`/build`](https://github.com/picocherry/picotype/tree/main/build) directory
2. Install the fonts on your system:
   - **macOS**: Double-click the font files or use Font Book
   - **Linux**: Copy to `~/.local/share/fonts/` and run `fc-cache -f -v`
   - **Windows**: Right-click and select "Install"

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

If you want to add a new font, you should add it to the ./src folder.
The ./src folder structure is the following:
```
📁 familyname/
├── 📁 regular/
│   └── familyname-regular.ttf
├── 📁 italic/
│   └── familyname-italic.ttf
├── 📁 bold/
│   └── familyname-bold.ttf
└── 📁 bolditalic/
    └── familyname-bolditalic.ttf
```

then run 

```./build.sh```

script that will add metadata so that the OS knows all the different files are of the same font family.
build.sh will allow you to choose which font families you want to build, and the options you want to build them with. You will also be able to choose to patch with nerd fonts.

## Manual editing in FontForge

1. Install [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/downloads/mac/)
2. Open the font in FontForge
3. Element → Font Info...
4. General tab:
  - Fontname: unique font name including the font family and the variant. E.g. Helvetica Regular
  - Font Family: only the font family that needs to be the same on all fonts. E.g. Helvetica
  - Name for Humans: just use same as font family
5. TTF Names tab: 
  - \<New\> → English (US) → Preferred Family → e.g. Helvetica
  - \<New\> → English (US) → Preferred Styles → e.g. Regular
  - if you changed the Fontname, update the UniqueID as well
6. File → Generate Fonts...
  - check validate before saving
  - use TrueType
  - No BitMap Fonts
  - Generate


## Patching to nerd fonts

Install python (`brew install python` on mac)

run `./generate`

This will generate the nerd fonts and put them in the `/build` directory.

### Manual patching command:

```
fontforge --script ./patcher/font-patcher --careful --mono --complete --simple ./picotype/picotype-regular.ttf
```

the `--simple` argument preservers the lowercase convention of all pico fonts so you don't need to use fontforge again
